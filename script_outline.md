# Game Outline
=======

## Goal: Create a game that lets a young woman decide what kind of engineering she'd like to pursue!

## Part 1: Introduce protagonist
*characteristics of protagonist*
* Graduated with a degree in engineering, but had a head injury

### Scene: You arrive at the office of engineering corp
<< What does this company do? >>
"It's your first day on the job at an engineering firm, but you don't know what role you're going to be taking. You're trying to remember what you were hired for/what you said in interview."

*flashback? to interview*
### Interview Scene
"What do you like"
"What are you passionate about"
"Why engineering"
* I love helping people
* I wanted to do something creative
* I just wanted lots of money and stability, to be dangerouly honest
* I wanted a hands-on career
* I hate people and I didn't want to be in any career that involved people. Please, just the microscope and the desk and a closed unventilated room. 
* I love being outside I would die being inside a building all day

### Nested flashback, to university when you were deciding what you wanted to pursue. 

## Part 3: Deeper questions
*Receptionist takes you to a department based on the branch of engineering you selected, and you meet your department manager for the first time. They ask you some deeper questions to see what to assign you to on your first day.*
* Severely understaffed so they're not even checking credentials, anyone with a pulse and a degree*
* Firm = best engineering, worst HR *
