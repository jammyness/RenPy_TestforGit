# Game Outline
=======

## Goal: Create a game that lets a young woman decide what kind of engineering she'd like to pursue!

## Part 1: Introduce protagonist
*characteristics of protagonist*
* Graduated with a degree in engineering, but had a head injury

### Scene: You arrive at the office of engineering corp
<< What does this company do? >>
"It's your first day on the job at an engineering firm, but you don't know what role you're going to be taking. You're trying to remember what you were hired for/what you said in interview."

*flashback? to interview*
### Interview Scene
"What do you like"
"What are you passionate about"
"Why engineering"
* I love helping people
* I wanted to do something creative
* I just wanted lots of money and stability, to be dangerouly honest
* I wanted a hands-on career
* I hate people and I didn't want to be in any career that involved people. Please, just the microscope and the desk and a closed unventilated room. 

### Nested flashback, to university when you were deciding what you wanted to pursue. 

## Part 3: Deeper questions
*Receptionist takes you to a department based on the branch of engineering you selected, and you meet your department manager for the first time. They ask you some deeper questions to see what to assign you to on your first day.*
* Severely understaffed so they're not even checking credentials, anyone with a pulse and a degree*
* Firm = best engineering, worst HR *

## Part 4: Selection/Recommendation
* Meet your colleages *

Other people you are working with will talk about their experiences and their backgrounds! 
List real life people who actually work in these fields (with links to linkedin profiles)

## Epilogue: A day in the life, ten years later
* Goes through a day from waking up commuting, what they do all day, who they talk to, the projects they're working on and what they've achieved!*
* Get home after a long day at work and you find your degree and it's right or wrong hahaha*
